**Rate Limiting Nullifier**

Rate limiting nullifier (RLN) is a construct based on zero-knowledge proofs (sometimes called ZKP gadget) that provides an anonymous rate-limited signaling/messaging framework suitable for decentralized (and centralized) environments using Secret Shamir Sharing (SSS) scheme.

**Motivation**
Some applications of rate limiting nullifier in anonymous decentralized networks include:
1. Decentralized voting applications: RLN helps prevent voting outcomes from being manipulated by spam or sybil attacks, ensuring the integrity of the voting process. 
2. Anonymous group chat applications: By preventing users from spamming or polluting group chats, RLN enhances the user experience in these applications.
3. Direct anonymous attestation: RLN can be used in combination with Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) to implement service rate-limiting in a scenario where messages between users and the service are sent anonymously while preserving message unlinkability
4. Blockchain-based social networks: RLN can be applied to decentralized social media networks to prevent spam, sybil attacks, and other types of abuse targeting APIs and applications, thus enhancing the overall security and reliability of these networks.
5. Rate limiting in web applications: RLN can be integrated with Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to protect against denial-of-service attacks, brute-force login attempts, and API traffic surges, providing a more secure and reliable web application experience. 

**RLN V2**
The RLN V2 protocol is a more general construct, that allows to set various limits for an epoch (it’s 1 message per epoch in RLN-V1) while remaining almost as simple as it predecessor. Moreover, it allows to set different rate-limits for different RLN app users based on some public data, e.g. stake.

The RLN Circom circuits were reviewed over 13 days. The code review was performed between May 31 and June 12, 2023. The RLN repository was under active development during the review, but the review was limited to the latest commit, [37073131b9](https://github.com/Rate-Limiting-Nullifier/circom-rln/tree/37073131b9c5910228ad6bdf0fc50080e507166a) at the start of the review. 

The official documentation for the RLN circuits was located at [rate-limiting-nullifier.github.io](https://rate-limiting-nullifier.github.io/rln-docs/).

After the findings were presented to the RLN team, fixes were made and included in several PRs.

This review is a code review to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code. The reviewers did not investigate security practices or operational security and assumed that privileged accounts could be trusted. The reviewers did not evaluate the security of the code relative to a standard or specification. The review may not have identified all potential attack vectors or areas of vulnerability.

yAcademy and the auditors make no warranties regarding the security of the code and do not warrant that the code is free from defects. yAcademy and the auditors do not represent nor imply to third parties that the code has been audited nor that the code is free from defects. By deploying or using the code, RLN and users of the contracts agree to use the code at their own risk.

## Critical Findings

None.

## High Findings

None.

## Medium Findings

None.

## Low Findings

### 1. Low - Incosistency between RLN contract and RLN circuit on the number of bits for userMessageLimit

In RLN.sol, the messageLimit can take upto 2**256 - 1 values whereas messageId & userMessageLimit values in circuits is restricted to 2**16 - 1 .

[rln.circom](https://github.com/Rate-Limiting-Nullifier/circom-rln/blob/37073131b9c5910228ad6bdf0fc50080e507166a/circuits/rln.circom)

```circom
template RLN(DEPTH, LIMIT_BIT_SIZE) {
...
    // messageId range check
    RangeCheck(LIMIT_BIT_SIZE)(messageId, userMessageLimit);
...
}
component main { public [x, externalNullifier] } = RLN(20, 16);
```

[rln.sol](https://github.com/Rate-Limiting-Nullifier/rln-contracts/blob/main/src/RLN.sol)
```solidity
uint256 messageLimit = amount / MINIMAL_DEPOSIT;
```

**Recommended Solution**

Update the relevant code at [rln.sol](https://github.com/Rate-Limiting-Nullifier/rln-contracts/blob/main/src/RLN.sol) with something like below:

```solidity
function register(uint256 identityCommitment, uint256 amount) external {
        ...
        uint256 messageLimit = amount / MINIMAL_DEPOSIT;
        require( messageLimit <= type(uint16).max , "Max length of your message limit is 65535");
        ...
    }
```



### 2. Low - Unused `address` input signal in the Withdraw circuit

The input signal `address` was declared but not used in the output calculation. 

```circom
    signal input address;
```
**Recommended Solution**
Assign a local computation for the unused input signal `address`. For example:

```circom
   signal addressDoubled <== address + address;
```

### 3. Low - Missing rangechecks for the data inputs

The Circom circuits are missing explicit rangechecks for several input parameters suchh as `DEPTH`, `address`, `LIMIT_BIT_SIZE`, etc. 

**Recommended Solution**
Perform explcit range checks and constrain the data input parameters to improve the soundness of the ZKP system.

## Informational Findings
The Circom circuits are further tested for `Weak Verification` soundness property using [Ecne tool](https://github.com/franklynwang/EcneProject) from 0xParc. This tests if, given the input variables in a QAP (R1CS constraints), the output variables have uniquely determined values. An underconstrained circuit admits valid proofs for multiple different outputs, given the same input. In the worst case, an attacker can generate a valid proof for an underconstrained circuit for any output--meaning that an attacker would be able to convince a verifier who (incorrectly) believes the circuit to be properly-constrained that the attacker knows the pre-image of arbitrary outputs.

### Ecne Findings
The Circom cuits were compiled to non-optimized R1CS constraints system and then they were tested for `Weak Verification` to check for any bad constraints or underconstraints. All the circuits passed the Ecne tests without any bad or underconstraints. This verifies that R1CS equations of the given circuits uniquely determine outputs given inputs (i.e. that the constraints are sound).

### Error Handling
Consider adding below error handling to check for specific conditions and throw an error or return an error code when those conditions are not met. This helps provide meaningful error messages or handle exceptional cases in a controlled manner.

**`rln.circom`**
```circom
// Add error handling for Merkle tree inclusion proof
root <== MerkleTreeInclusionProof(DEPTH)(rateCommitment, identityPathIndex, pathElements);
assert(root !== 0, "Invalid Merkle tree inclusion proof"); // Throw an error if the Merkle tree inclusion proof is invalid

```
**`withdraw.circom`**
```circom
// Add error handling for address length check
assert(address.length == EXPECTED_ADDRESS_LENGTH, "Invalid address length"); // Throw an error if the address length is not as expected

```
**`utils.circom`**
```circom

// Add error handling for length check
assert(leaf.length == EXPECTED_LEAF_LENGTH, "Invalid leaf length"); // Throw an error if the leaf length is not as expected
```
### `POSEIDON` and Some Additional Remarks
- The RLN circuit assumes that the underlying hash function (`Poseidon`) is:
    * Collision-resistant
    * Resistant to differential, algebraic, and interpolation attacks
    * Behaves as a random oracle
- The Merkle tree used for membership proof is assumed to be secure against second-preimage attacks.
- The security of the circuit depends on the security of the cryptographic primitives used for range checks and SSS share calculations.
- The security of the circuit also depends on the secrecy of the `identitySecret` signal, which is assumed to be kept secret by the user.
- Social engineering attacks are still a valid way to break the system.
- An attacker can obtain the `identitySecret` signal of a user by using methods such as social engineering, phishing attacks, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the user's system.
- Once the attacker has obtained the `identitySecret` signal, they can calculate the `identityCommitment`, `rateCommitment`, `a1`, and `y` signals for that user, and use them to break the security of the RLN circuit.


## Final remarks
Overall, the code demonstrates good implementation of mathematical operations and basic functionality. However, it could benefit from more extensive documentation and additional testing and verification procedures.
